## Why Further Development

1. Some features of folder-explorer were redundant for me and didn't fit my usage habits.
2. In folder-explorer, you need to export to see the configuration effect each time, which I found inconvenient. I wanted real-time preview.
3. When editing notes in folder-explorer, you need to right-click to open the edit note menu each time, which I personally found not very convenient.

## Features

1. ‚ú® Real-time preview: View the annotated file tree effect in real-time without exporting text, making document writing more intuitive and efficient.
2. üñä Convenient annotation: Easily write annotations by switching input boxes, avoiding cumbersome right-click menu operations and improving efficiency.
3. üö´ File and folder ignoring: Support ignoring specific folders and file types, ensuring only the file structure you need is displayed, keeping the file tree concise.
4. üìÇ Automatic opening of exported files: Automatically open files after exporting, no need to manually search for files, saving time and making the workflow smoother.

# Feature Introduction

## Scanning

> After clicking the scan button, open the file selector, choose the folder you want to scan, and start scanning.

## Global Configuration

### Automatically Open Files

> Automatically open files after exporting.

### Ignore Folders

> Ignore folders that don't need to be scanned to avoid performance loss or even program unresponsiveness, such as the node_modules folder. The program automatically ignores the node_modules folder internally.

### Ignore Folders Starting with "."

> These folders are hidden by default on MacOS and Linux.

### Scan Only Folders

> Ignore all files and scan only folders.

### Ignore Files Starting with "."

> These files are hidden by default on MacOS and Linux.

### Ignore File Types

> After scanning once, all file types from this scan will be generated. You can choose to ignore unnecessary file types to improve scanning efficiency.

### Scanning Depth

> Set the depth of directory scanning. 0 means all depths, each increment in number represents +1 scanning depth.

### Default Name

> Configure the default name for exported text.

## Preview Area Configuration

### Annotation Formatting

> Format for filling in annotations

### Minimum Bridge Characters

> Number of bridge characters displayed at the longest path

### Bridge Fill Character

> Enter a single-byte fill character, such as: \*, #, $, -, @, \_, etc.

### Always Show Bridge

> Configure whether to display the bridge where there are no annotations.

## Export

> After setting the relevant configurations and writing annotations, export the annotated file tree structure.

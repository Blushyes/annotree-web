## Project Introduction

> This project is based on folder-explorer and has been further developed. Thanks to FairyEver for the creativity and contribution!

This is my first official open-source project. If it helps you, please Star ‚≠êÔ∏è and share it with your friends. It means a lot to me, thank you üíó!
Official documentation: https://annotree.com
**For the latest version download, please visit [Github Release](https://github.com/itchaox/annotree/releases)**

> Project vision: To grow and thrive, creating brilliance! To become the standard solution for directory annotation trees globally!

> TipsÔºöOur project currently only supports Chinese language, but will soon support English language as well. You can star‚≠êÔ∏è this project to stay updated with the latest information. Thank you for your interestüíó!

## Why Further Development

1. Some features of folder-explorer were redundant for me and didn't fit my usage habits.
2. In folder-explorer, you need to export to see the configuration effect each time, which I found inconvenient. I wanted real-time preview.
3. When editing notes in folder-explorer, you need to right-click to open the edit note menu each time, which I personally found not very convenient.

## Features

1. ‚ú® Real-time preview: View the annotated file tree effect in real-time without exporting text, making document writing more intuitive and efficient.
2. üñä Convenient annotation: Easily write annotations by switching input boxes, avoiding cumbersome right-click menu operations and improving efficiency.
3. üö´ File and folder ignoring: Support ignoring specific folders and file types, ensuring only the file structure you need is displayed, keeping the file tree concise.
4. üìÇ Automatic opening of exported files: Automatically open files after exporting, no need to manually search for files, saving time and making the workflow smoother.

# Feature Introduction

## Scanning

> After clicking the scan button, open the file selector, choose the folder you want to scan, and start scanning.

## Global Configuration

### Automatically Open Files

> Automatically open files after exporting.

![20240713233511_rec_.gif](https://itchao-1318613604.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/20240713233511_rec_.gif)

### Ignore Folders

> Ignore folders that don't need to be scanned to avoid performance loss or even program unresponsiveness, such as the node_modules folder. The program automatically ignores the node_modules folder internally.

### Ignore Folders Starting with "."

> These folders are hidden by default on MacOS and Linux.

### Scan Only Folders

> Ignore all files and scan only folders.

### Ignore File Types

> After scanning once, all file types from this scan will be generated. You can choose to ignore unnecessary file types to improve scanning efficiency.

### Scanning Depth

> Set the depth of directory scanning. 0 means all depths, each increment in number represents +1 scanning depth.
